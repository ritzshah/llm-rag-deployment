# Important notes

OpenCV for Python comes in two flavors, standard and headless. The Headless version is the one required inside a container image, otherwise the command `import cv2`  will fail.

That's because the standard version has dependencies on OS packages related to display, which you obviously don't have in a container. However, it i listed as a dependency by several other libraries which expect you to run on a desktop/laptop! Therefore we need to make sure only the headless version is installed.

The `requirements.txt` file used to build the container image is generated in this way:

- Create a Pipfile with the needed packages
- Lock the packages (`pipenv lock`)
- Create the requirement.txt with `pipenv requirements > requirement.txt`
- Edit `requirements.txt` and remove the package `opencv-python` (which has been "injected" as a dependency), it was not in the Pipfile, but keep `opencv-python-headless`
- `requirements.txt` content will be installed when the container is built with the option `no-dependencies` to avoid unwanted packages to come back... This option is really needed, otherwise pip will install the standard opencv version again as a dependency...
